# Machine Learning Dummy Variables Exercise

This repository contains a practice exercise that focuses on creating dummy variables in machine learning. The exercise utilizes the `carprices.csv` dataset, which is provided by codebasics.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this exercise is `carprices.csv`, which is included in the repository. It is provided by codebasics and contains information about car prices, including various features such as car model, mileage, age, and sell_price.

## Exercise Description

The goal of this exercise is to demonstrate how to create dummy variables, which are useful in representing categorical data for machine learning models. Specifically, the exercise will guide you through the process of converting categorical variables into numerical representation using dummy variables.

By completing this exercise, you will learn:

- How to identify categorical variables in a dataset.
- How to create dummy variables using pandas library in Python.
- How to interpret and use the generated dummy variables for machine learning tasks.

## Getting Started

To get started with the exercise, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies, such as Python and pandas.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (`dummy_variables_exercise.ipynb`) using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
4. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to complete the exercise.
5. Experiment and modify the code as needed to deepen your understanding of dummy variables.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas library

## Resources

- `carprices.csv`: The dataset file containing car prices information.
- `dummy_variables_exercise.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook file that provides the exercise instructions and code template.

## License
